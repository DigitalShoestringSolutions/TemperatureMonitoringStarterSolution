#    Temperature Monitoring (Basic solution) -- This digital solution enables, measures,
#    reports and records different  types of temperatures (ambient, process, equipment)
#    so that the temperature conditions surrounding a process can be understood and 
#    taken action upon. This version can work for 4 types of temperature sensors (now)
#    which include k-type, RTD, ambient (AHT20), and NIR-based sensors. 
#    The solution provides a Grafana dashboard that 
#    displays the temperature timeseries, set threshold value, and a state timeline showing the chnage in temperature.
#    An InfluxDB database is used to store timestamp, temperature, threshold and status.
